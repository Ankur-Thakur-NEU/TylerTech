# Instructions for Running the Asp.net core web api Project
1. Open Terminal.

I have configured postgresql in the application. the configuration of connection string is in .env file
3. Once the api is running , go inside EnerGovApp folder and open it in terminal, Run "npm install" to install all the depencies after that Run "ng serve" command to run the Angular project.
